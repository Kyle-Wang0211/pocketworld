// Visual structure (bottom-up):
//   • Square frame (aspect 1:1).
//   • Background = live 3D rendering of the work's .glb via Thermion
//     (Filament-backed; renders into a Flutter Texture). Multiple
//     cards each run their own Filament View — they all stay live as
//     you scroll. Auto-rotate is on only for the "focused" card
//     (most-centered in viewport); the rest sit still. Cards that
//     fall below the visibility threshold drop the live viewer and
//     show a static thumbnail so we don't keep N Filament textures
//     alive off-screen.
//   • Glass info plate floats over the bottom of the model. Because
//     Thermion writes pixels into the Flutter framebuffer (not an iOS
//     hardware overlay like the previous WKWebView path), liquid_glass
//     can SAMPLE the helmet behind the plate for REAL refraction.
//
// Cross-platform: Thermion (Filament FFI on iOS / Android / macOS /
// Windows; WASM/WebGL on Web) + visibility_detector + Flutter stock
// widgets. HarmonyOS rides on whichever Flutter-on-ohos channel impl
// is current (officially unsupported by Thermion upstream).
