// LiveModelView — Thermion (Filament) viewer that loads a .glb from a
// network URL at runtime and renders into a Flutter Texture.
//
// Why this exists: liquid_glass_renderer's GPU shader can only sample
// pixels that live in the Flutter framebuffer. WKWebView (the previous
// model_viewer_plus path) draws as an iOS hardware overlay, invisible
// to the shader → glass rendered as a flat dark color. Thermion writes
// straight into a Flutter Texture, so the helmet pixels are sampleable
// and the glass plate refracts them for real.
//
// Multi-instance: each ViewerWidget allocates its own Filament View /
// Scene / Camera / SwapChain off the shared FilamentApp. Mounting
// several at once (one per visible feed card) is supported; throttle
// via the parent's visibility threshold so we don't burn GPU on cards
// scrolling past.
//
// Loading: bytes flow GlbCache.fetch(url) → loadGltfFromBuffer. The
// raw-bytes path sidesteps loadGltf's path/asset/file:// resolution.
//
// ──── Two structural problems we fix here ─────────────────────────────
//
// (1) RED FLASH on mount/remount.
//     Thermion's stack: ViewerWidget → ThermionWidget → ThermionTextureWidget.
//     `ThermionTextureWidget.build` returns `Container(color: Colors.red)`
//     when its Flutter Texture descriptor isn't yet allocated, AND
//     `ViewerWidget` does NOT forward `initial` down to ThermionWidget,
//     so the inner red fallback is what shows for the ~few frames
//     between createViewer and texture allocation.
//
//     Fix: stack an opaque cover ABOVE the ViewerWidget, painted in
//     widget.background, kept until our asset has finished loading
//     (`_modelReady`). The cover is INSIDE LiveModelView's tree, so
//     it survives detail-page push/pop without flickering.
//
// (2) ROTATION FREEZE after detail-page pop (no red flash case).
//     Bare Dart `Timer.periodic` is NOT bound to Flutter's TickerMode.
//     During a route transition, the underlying route is moved offstage
//     and Filament's render loop pauses; my timer kept firing camera
//     updates into a stalled renderer, and on return the rendering
//     pipeline didn't pick the changes back up — model appeared frozen.
//
//     Fix: use a Flutter `Ticker` (via SingleTickerProviderStateMixin).
//     Tickers AUTOMATICALLY mute on offstage routes and resume on the
//     route returning to the foreground. No manual deactivate/activate
//     dance.
//
// ──── Camera + lighting ───────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// ViewerWidget owns the Camera; we cache a handle in onViewerAvailable
// so the rotation tick / orbit gestures don't FFI-call getActiveCamera
// per frame. Lighting is IBL-ONLY — a neutral environment cube loaded
// from `assets/ibl/default_env_ibl.ktx`, no directional lights. This
// matches Polycam / Luma AI / Scaniverse's "scan viewer" style: capture-
// baked lighting in baseColor textures shouldn't be double-lit by the
// viewer.
//
// ──── Color ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Postprocessing is ON (gives us FXAA), but we override Filament's
// default ACES tone mapper to LINEAR — ACES pushes a pure-white scene
// toward film-warm yellow. Filament's clear color is set to FULLY
// TRANSPARENT and the LiveModelView wraps everything in a
// ColoredBox(white) so Flutter's compositor paints the background.
//
// ──── Interaction ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// When [interactive] is true (detail page) we DON'T use Thermion's
// built-in ORBIT manipulator — its sensitivity is fixed at 0.001/event
// with no per-axis inversion knob. Instead we mount with NONE and drive
// the camera ourselves from a Flutter GestureDetector: 1-finger drag =
// orbit (Y inverted, ≈5× more responsive than Thermion default),
// 2-finger pinch = zoom.
//
// ──── Cross-platform ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Thermion supports iOS / Android / macOS / Windows / Web (WASM).
// HarmonyOS is best-effort like every other Flutter plugin without an
// official ohos channel impl.

  // pop back on, Ticker.elapsed pauses-and-resumes as expected, but
  // Flutter ALSO sometimes recreates the State (sticky-mount unmount
  // after 5s timeout, parent rebuilds with focus changes, etc.) and a
  // freshly-started ticker has elapsed=0 → would snap angle back to 0.
  // Worse, after a long pause Ticker.elapsed can lurch forward by the

  // 1. We deliberately set `transformToUnitCube: false` on the

  //    0.3.4's transformToUnitCube produces a scale that doesn't
  //    always agree with the documented "longest axis maps to
  //    [-1, 1]" — in our reproduction a model with hyLocal=1 ended
  //    up rendering at ~10% of viewport instead of the predicted
  //    ~80%, suggesting an ~8x scale mismatch. Skipping
  //    transformToUnitCube and computing in the model's own units
  //    makes the math match what's actually on screen.
  //
  // 2. We cache the model's local AABB center and use it as the
  //    lookAt focus everywhere — local AABBs are NOT necessarily
  //    centered at origin (especially for re-exported scan GLBs),
  //    and lookAt(focus: zero) on an off-center model just stares
