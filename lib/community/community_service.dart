// Supabase queries that power the community feed.
//
// Three responsibilities:
//   • fetchPublicFeed — a paginated read of public works joined with
//     authoring profiles, plus a bulk work_likes lookup so each card
//     knows whether the current user has liked it.
//   • toggleLike       — flips the current user's like on a work.
//                        Schema-side trigger maintains works.likes_count.
//   • thumbnailUrlFor / modelUrlFor — turn storage paths into
//     publicly-resolvable URLs (or signed URLs for private buckets).
//
// Cross-platform: pure Dart on top of supabase_flutter, runs identically
// on iOS / Android / HarmonyOS / Web.
